      <h2>ðŸ“Œ Raising The Bar</h2>
      <p>
        I built <strong>Raising The Bar</strong> from the ground up â€” not just the code, but the entire <strong>user
          experience</strong>, <strong>business infrastructure</strong>, and <strong>launch stack</strong>. From
        <strong>backend logic</strong> and <strong>dynamic content generation</strong> to <strong>Stripe
          payments</strong>, <strong>email flows</strong>, and <strong>ad platform integration</strong>, every part of
        this product has been thoughtfully engineered and executed by me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a fully <strong>adaptive fitness tracker</strong> that adjusts workouts and meals based on
        real-life feedback. Users receive <strong>tailored plans</strong>, build <strong>streaks</strong>, log
        <strong>progress</strong>, and unlock <strong>insights</strong> â€” all from a clean web-based experience. I also
        designed the <strong>onboarding journey</strong>, <strong>upsell flow</strong>, and <strong>analytics
          tracking</strong> to ensure we capture behavior and improve retention from day one.
      </p>

                The Workout Tracker automatically adapts to your performance and consistency. It includes XP, levels,

                After completing a short form, users receive a fully tailored workout and nutrition program built around

                that data â€” instantly usable inside the tracker.

                Each workout is interactive â€” users can log every set, track reps and weight, and earn XP as they go.
                The tracker supports auto-checking when targets are hit, adaptive rest timers, and even YouTube tutorial
                links. Users can also swap exercises on the fly, with intelligent suggestions that match their current

                The tracker adapts to each user's performance in real time. If they exceed or fall short of the
                suggested reps, the system responds with tailored adjustments â€” no guesswork needed. This ensures the
                program stays responsive, personalized, and perfectly matched to the user's ability each session.
